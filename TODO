New:

DONE:
Allow writing of accurate png files
Use the command-line options from rockxray for aiming
Use the voxel stuff from bob.c for pixel values
Use png-writing code from rockxray for the output

Old:
Get stickkit to dump .rad segments and nodes as 10 different "def6"-type things
That way, I can turn def0 into "light" and the others into "glow"
